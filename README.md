Building a survey form

Utilizing ai to learn the basics and create a faster workflow, some of the errors i come across is being a master in every said language. I call it the syntax of doom just to keep it simple. Rather then call it imposter syndrome, more times then not we are speaking multiple languages and if you are not bilingual in real life then it could be extremely tough to graps new languages in programming.I am multi-lingual while my coding skills are vastly in need for a improvement, I can substitute with my ability to problem solve, I just need my tools to help not solve.


My advice would be to hone in on the topics you love by buying the book and engulfing yourself in some code snippets that way you train a model or feed an ai snippets that should work. Snippets will take off more then artificial intelligence itll be the aglet to a shoe lace
